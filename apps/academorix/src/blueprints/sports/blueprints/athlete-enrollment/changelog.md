# athlete-enrollment — changelog

## [Unreleased] — inception (Wave 3a)

- AthleteEnrollment module authored. One owned entity:
  - `AthleteEnrollment` (`aen_` prefix) — roster attachment binding Athlete to
    Team + Season.
- Three entitlement gates:
  - `athlete_enrollment_slot` (per-season cap: Small=15 / Medium=250 /
    Enterprise=unlimited).
  - `athlete_enrollment_waitlist` (Medium+).
  - `athlete_enrollment_provisional` (Enterprise-only).
- Enrollment state machine: submitted → payment_pending/consent_pending →
  confirmed → active → completed / withdrawn / expelled / expired / waitlisted →
  promotion path.
- Load-bearing invariants:
  - One active enrollment per (athlete, team, season) via partial unique index.
  - Jersey number uniqueness per active team roster.
  - ATOMIC CONVERSION to teams::TeamMember when status → active, enforced by
    ConvertEnrollmentToTeamMemberAtomically hook +
    ReconcileEnrollmentTeamMemberInvariantJob.
- Age-group snapshot semantics: `age_group_snapshot_id` FROZEN at submission
  (birthday drift + AgeGroup catalog changes do NOT reshape it).
- Consent snapshot at confirm-time preserves the athlete's consent state for
  regulator audit.
- Trial conversion path: `enrollment_type='trial_converted'` + `source_trial_id`
  references originating TeamTrial.
- Cascade paths: AthleteArchived/Withdrawn/Graduated → cascade to enrollments
  (via cascade=true). TeamArchived + SeasonArchived → refuse when active
  enrollments exist. SeasonStarted → auto-activate confirmed enrollments.
  SeasonCompleted → cascade complete active enrollments.
- Retention: terminal enrollments retain 7 years (season-history + federation
  compliance).
- 20 published events. 12 notification categories.
- Four broadcast channels: tenant / team / athlete / user.
- SDUI: 3 screens (list + submit + edit) + 3 widgets (enrollment-status-chip /
  roster-slot-indicator / waitlist-position-badge).
- Six scheduled jobs (Activate / PromoteWaitlisted / ExpireProvisional /
  NotifyDeadlines / Reconcile / Purge).

### Compatibility

- Depends on `foundation`, `tenancy`, `application`, `organization`, `region`,
  `branch`, `entitlements`, `teams`, `athlete`, `season`, `age-group`.
- Extended by NONE. Planned consumers: event, session, finance, notifications,
  attendance.

### Design notes

- No `application_id` / `organization_id` / `region_id` / `scope_node_id` on
  enrollment rows.
- team_id + athlete_id + season_id + branch_id + tenant_id +
  age_group_snapshot_id + enrollment_type + source_trial_id are IMMUTABLE
  post-create.
- The atomic conversion invariant is THE load-bearing correctness property.
  Every EnrollmentAtomicityFailed event is P1.
- Consent snapshot is a POINT-IN-TIME copy — preserves compliance evidence even
  when the parent Athlete's consents change.
- Position + jersey_number_assigned enforced unique per active team roster.
- Withdrawal + expulsion require reason (anti-discrimination compliance).

### ULID prefix registration

- `aen_` (AthleteEnrollment) — new. Register in
  `modules/shared/blueprints/foundation/data/ulid-prefixes.json`. 3-char
  lowercase.

### Wave 3a → 3b migration notes

- Wave 3b lands Athlete.branch_id transfer — enrollments stay on the ORIGINAL
  branch (branch_id is denormalised + immutable). New enrollments after transfer
  bind to the new branch.
- Wave 4+ Finance module hooks payment_status transitions + fires
  EnrollmentPaymentStatusChanged from Finance side.
- Wave 4+ Attendance module reads enrollment_id via BelongsToAthleteEnrollment
  trait.
